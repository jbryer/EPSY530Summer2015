\frametitle{Modeling numerical variables}

In this unit we will learn to quantify the relationship between two numerical variables, as well as modeling numerical response variables using a numerical or categorical explanatory variable.

\frametitle{Poverty vs. HS graduate rate}

The \hl{scatterplot} below shows the relationship between HS graduate rate in all 50 US states and DC and the \% of residents who live below the poverty line {\small (income below \$23,050 for a family of 4 in 2012)}.

\frametitle{Quantifying the relationship}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Correlation} describes the strength of the \red{linear} association between two variables.

\pause

\item It takes values between -1 (perfect negative) and +1 (perfect positive).

\pause

\item A value of 0 indicates no linear association.

\end{itemize}
