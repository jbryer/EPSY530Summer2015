\dq{Suppose we randomly select four individuals to participate in this experiment. What is the probability that exactly 1 of them will refuse to administer the shock?}
\pause
Let's call these people Allen (A), Brittany (B), Caroline (C), and Damian (D). Each one of the four scenarios below will satisfy the condition of ``exactly 1 of them refuses to administer the shock": \\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\pause
\begin{changemargin}{+1.5cm}{+0cm}
{\footnotesize
\begin{enumerate}
\item[Scenario 1:] $\slot{0.35}{\text{(A) \red{refuse}}} \times \slot{0.65}{\text{(B) shock}} \times \slot{0.65}{\text{(C) shock}} \times \slot{0.65}{\text{(D) shock}} = 0.0961$
\pause
\item[Scenario 2:] $\slot{0.65}{\text{(A) shock}} \times \slot{0.35}{\text{(B) \red{refuse}}}\times \slot{0.65}{\text{(C) shock}} \times \slot{0.65}{\text{(D) shock}} = 0.0961$
\pause
\item[Scenario 3:] $\slot{0.65}{\text{(A) shock}} \times \slot{0.65}{\text{(B) shock}} \times \slot{0.35}{\text{(C) \red{refuse}}}\times \slot{0.65}{\text{(D) shock}} = 0.0961$
\pause
\item[Scenario 4:] $\slot{0.65}{\text{(A) shock}} \times \slot{0.65}{\text{(B) shock}} \times \slot{0.65}{\text{(C) shock}} \times \slot{0.35}{\text{(D) \red{refuse}}} = 0.0961$
\end{enumerate}
}
\end{changemargin}
\pause
The probability of exactly one 1 of 4 people refusing to administer the shock is the sum of all of these probabilities.
\[ 0.0961+ 0.0961 + 0.0961 + 0.0961 = 4 \times 0.0961 = 0.3844 \]

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Binomial distribution}

The question from the prior slide asked for the probability of given number of successes, \mathhl{k}, in a given number of trials, \mathhl{n}, ($k = 1$ success in $n = 4$ trials), and we calculated this probability as
\[ \#~of~scenarios \times P(single~scenario) \]

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item $\#~of~scenarios$: there is a less tedious way to figure this out, we'll get to that shortly...

\pause

\item $P(single~scenario) = p^k~(1-p)^{(n-k)}$ \\
{\tiny probability of success to the power of number of successes, probability of failure to the power of number of failures}

\end{itemize}

\pause

The \hl{Binomial distribution} describes the probability of having exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernouilli trials with probability of success $p$.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Counting the \# of scenarios}

Earlier we wrote out all possible scenarios that fit the condition of exactly one person refusing to administer the shock. If $n$ was larger and/or $k$ was different than 1, for example, $n = 9$ and $k = 2$:

\pause

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
\red{R}\red{R}SSSSSSS \\ 
\pause
S\red{R}\red{R}SSSSSS \\
\pause
SS\red{R}\red{R}SSSSS \\
$\cdots$ \\
SS\red{R}SS\red{R}SSS \\
$\cdots$ \\
SSSSSSS\red{R}\red{R} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

writing out all possible scenarios would be incredibly tedious and prone to errors.

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Calculating the \# of scenarios}

\formula{Choose function}
{
The \hl{choose function} is useful for calculating the number of ways to choose $k$ successes in $n$ trials.
\[ {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n - k)!} \]
}

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item $k = 1$, $n = 4$: ${4 \choose 1} = \frac{4!}{1! (4 - 1)!} = \frac{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{1 \times (3 \times 2 \times 1)} = 4$

\pause

\item $k = 2$, $n = 9$: ${9 \choose 2} = \frac{9!}{2! (9 - 1)!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7!}{2 \times 1 \times 7!} = \frac{72}{2} = 36$

\end{itemize}

Somewhat complicated to calculate, but we can think of it as the complement of the probability that there are no matches in 121 people.

\vspace{-0.75cm}

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(no~matches) &=& 1 \times \pr{1 - \frac{1}{365}} \times \pr{1 - \frac{2}{365}} \times \cdots \times \pr{1 - \frac{120}{365}} \\

\dq{A 2012 Gallup survey suggests that 26.2\% of Americans are obese. \\  

Among a random sample of 100 Americans, how many would you expect to be obese?}

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item Easy enough, $100 \times 0.262 = 26.2$.

\pause

\item Or more formally, $\mu = np = 100 \times 0.262 = 26.2$.

\pause

\item But this doesn't mean in every random sample of 100 people exactly 26.2 will be obese. In fact, that's not even possible. In some samples this value will be less, and in others more. How much would we expect this value to vary?

\formula{Mean and standard deviation of binomial distribution}
{\[ \mu = np \qquad \qquad \sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} \] }

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item Going back to the obesity rate:

\[ \sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{100 \times 0.262 \times 0.738} \approx  4.4\]

\pause

\item We would expect 26.2 out of 100 randomly sampled Americans to be obese, with a standard deviation of 4.4.

\end{itemize}

\Note{Mean and standard deviation of a binomial might not always be whole numbers, and that is alright, these values represent what we would expect to see on average.}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Unusual observations}

Using the notion that \hl{observations that are more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean are considered unusual} and the mean and the standard deviation we just computed, we can calculate a range for the plausible number of obese Americans in random samples of 100.

\[ 26.2 \pm (2 \times 4.4) = (17.4, 35) \]

\item Users in our sample pressed the like button next to friends' content an average of 14 times, but had their content ``liked" an average of 20 times
\item Users sent 9 personal messages, but received 12
\item 12\% of users tagged a friend in a photo, but 35\% were themselves tagged in a photo
\end{itemize}

What is the probability that the average Facebook user with 245 friends has 70 or more friends who would be considered power users? Note any assumptions you must make.}

We are given that $n = 245, p = 0.25$, and we are asked for the probability $P(K \ge 70)$. To proceed, we need independence, which we'll assume but could check if we had access to more Facebook data.

\pause

\begin{align*}
P(X \ge 70) &= P(K = 70\text{ or }K = 71\text{ or }K = 72\text{ or }\cdots\text{ or } K = 245) \\
&= P(K = 70) + P(K = 71) + P(K = 72) + \cdots + P(K = 245)

This seems like an awful lot of work...

\frametitle{Normal approximation to the binomial}

When the sample size is large enough, the binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$ can be approximated by the normal model with parameters $\mu = np$ and $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$.

\begin{itemize}

\item In the case of the Facebook power users, $n = 245$ and $p = 0.25$.
\[ \mu = 245 \times 0.25 = 61.25 \qquad \sigma = \sqrt{245 \times 0.25 \times 0.75} = 6.78 \]

\item $Bin(n = 245, p = 0.25) \approx N(\mu = 61.25, \sigma = 6.78)$.
