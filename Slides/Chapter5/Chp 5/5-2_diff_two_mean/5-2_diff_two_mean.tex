\dq{The General Social Survey (GSS) conducted by the Census Bureau contains a standard `core' of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Many of the core questions have remained unchanged since 1972 to facilitate time-trend studies as well as replication of earlier findings. Below is an excerpt from the 2010 data set. The variables are number of hours worked per week and highest educational attainment.}

\item Say we are only interested the difference between the number of hours worked per week by college and non-college graduates.

\item Then we combine the levels of education into two:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{hs or lower} $\leftarrow$ less than high school or high school
\item \texttt{coll or higher} $\leftarrow$ junior college, bachelor's, and graduate
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Parameter and point estimate}

\dq{We want to construct a 95\% confidence interval for the average difference between the number of hours worked per week by Americans with a college degree and those with a high school degree or lower. What are the parameter of interest and the point estimate?}

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Parameter of interest:} Average difference between the number of hours worked per week by \red{all}  Americans with a college degree and those with a high school degree or lower.
\[ \mu_{coll} - \mu_{hs} \]

\pause

\item \hl{Point estimate:} Average difference between the number of hours worked per week by \red{sampled}  Americans with a college degree and those with a high school degree or lower.
\[ \bar{x}_{coll} - \bar{x}_{hs} \]

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[shrink]
\frametitle{Checking assumptions \& conditions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \hl{Independence within groups: }
\begin{itemize}
\item Both the college graduates and those with HS degree or lower are sampled randomly.
\pause
\item 505 $<$ 10\% of all college graduates and 667 $<$ 10\% of all students with a high school degree or lower.
\end{itemize}
\pause
We can assume that the number of hours worked per week by one college graduate in the sample is independent of another, and the number of hours worked per week by someone with a HS degree or lower in the sample is independent of another as well.

\pause

\item \hl{Independence between groups: } \red{$\leftarrow$ new!} \\
Since the sample is random, the college graduates in the sample are independent of those with a HS degree or lower.

\pause

\item \hl{Sample size / skew:} \\
Both distributions look reasonably symmetric, and the sample sizes are at least 30, therefore we can assume that the sampling distribution of number of hours worked per week by college graduates and those with HS degree or lower are nearly normal. Hence the sampling distribution of the average difference will be nearly normal as well.

\end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Confidence interval for difference between two means}

\begin{itemize}

\item All confidence intervals have the same form:
\[ \textcolor{orange}{point~estimate \pm ME} \]

\pause

\item And all $ \textcolor{orange}{ME = critical~value \times SE~of~point~estimate}$

\pause

\item In this case the point estimate is $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$

\pause

\item Since the sample sizes are large enough, the critical value is $z^\star$

\pause

\item So the only new concept is the standard error of the difference between two means...

\end{itemize}

\[ SE_{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)} = \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} } \]
